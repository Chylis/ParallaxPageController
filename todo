1) Ability to add 'backgroundViewController' rather than 'backgroundImage' (or both?). Single code path and replicated view structure!
 - Should be done exactly the same way as the foreground controller is added, i.e. by creating a custom uiscrollview and adding the background view controllers view into it (don't forget to call the background view controller's life cycle methods)

2) Add motion effect + configurable value

3) Configurable:
  - Page control Y position
  - UIMotionEffect
  - uiimageview contentmode
